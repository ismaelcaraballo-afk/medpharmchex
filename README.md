# MedChex — Medication Interaction Checker

**Does it mix?** MedChex checks drug combinations for dangerous interactions, scores severity using real FDA adverse event data, and explains the risks in plain English using AI.

Built as a Pursuit L2 capstone project by Ismael Caraballo and Paula Maiguru.

---

## What It Does

1. **Look up drugs** — Resolves drug names to RxCUI codes via NIH RxNorm
2. **Check interactions** — Queries NIH RxNorm interaction database
3. **Score severity** — Analyzes FDA FAERS adverse event reports for real-world outcomes
4. **Explain in plain English** — Claude AI summarizes the risks in clear, non-clinical language

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/drug/rxcui` | GET | Resolve drug name → RxCUI |
| `/api/interactions` | GET | Check interactions by RxCUI list |
| `/api/faers` | GET | FDA adverse event data |
| `/api/score` | POST | Severity scoring (SAFE / CAUTION / DANGEROUS) |
| `/api/explain` | POST | Claude AI plain-English explanation |

## Why These Data Sources?

- **RxNorm** — NIH's official drug vocabulary. Industry standard for medication interoperability.
- **FDA FAERS** — Real-world adverse event reports submitted by doctors and patients. Severity is derived from actual outcomes, not AI guesses.
- **Claude AI** — Explains findings in plain language. The AI does *not* determine severity — that comes from FDA data.
